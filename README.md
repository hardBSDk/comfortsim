# Comfortsim

An open-source companion girl romance and hentai game

## Motivation

There's no open-source 3D romance and hentai game, I would like to give more freedom to players/artists and learn more in the process.

## Why Godot?

The Godot engine allows you to save a lot of time in development because of the node system, where the relationship between the game components is very easily and fast to implement things.

Also because of GDScript, the Godot scripting language allows you to write less code to implement things.

## Goals

- [ ] Animated girl
- [ ] The girl follows the player
- [ ] The girl can sit down
- [ ] The girl can touch the player
- [ ] The girl can kiss the player
- [ ] The girl can hug the player
- [ ] Girl eyetracking
- [ ] Allow the player to add custom 3D chracters

## Controls

- Arrow Keys/WASD - Move the player
